Hi!

I am a PhD candidate in Biology Department at University of Florida. I am a computational evolutionary biologist in [Dr. John Gordon Burleigh](https://biology.ufl.edu/gburleigh/)'s lab.

My research involves developing statistical approaches and computational methods to understand the generation and maintenance of biological diversity, and studying evolutionary patterns of diversification at both the species and genomic level. 


***Biodiversity and Macroevolution***

Details coming soon



***Using data cloning as a technique for evaluating identifiability in diversification model***

Details coming soon


***Genomic Diversity***

Details coming soon
