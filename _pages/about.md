Hi!

I am a PhD candidate in Biology Department at University of Florida. My work is supervised by [Dr. John Gordon Burleigh](https://biology.ufl.edu/gburleigh/). My broad research interests are phylogenetics, genomics and macroevolutionary modelling.


**Biodiversity and Macroevolution:** My research involves developing statistical and computational approaches to understand the generation and maintenance of biological diversity, and studying evolutionary patterns of diversification at both the species and genomic level. 


**Automating the Avian tree of life:** I have been working on building easy to use perl pipelines for automating the bird tree of life.
